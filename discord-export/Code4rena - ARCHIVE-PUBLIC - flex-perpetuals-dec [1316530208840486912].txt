Thank you, Could you also provide the oracle addresses we are using @Yuriy


[12/14/2024 13:54] flexcmt
Are you asking about EcoPyth oracle?


[12/14/2024 13:55] flexcmt
There is no deployed conctracts for Base Mainnet. But you can look at Base Sepolia's contracts. All the addresses are in the config: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-12-flex-perpetuals/blob/main/configs/base.sepolia.json

@Jay | C4 , is it possible to remove the Warden role from Yuriy, to make his name stand out in the discussion? (Warden's yellow takes over the Sponsors' purple)

> Only the changes made to the files within the defined scope need to be audited.

How can I detect the changes? Which one should I compare with? @Yuriy @FlexDev


[12/14/2024 22:32] flexcmt
The key point here is to avoid duplicating previous audits. If you want to track the changes, the best approach would be to review those made after the dates of the prior audits.


[12/14/2024 22:34] davies_0212
So, this audit is for only mitigation review?


[12/14/2024 22:39] flexcmt
To some extent, yes. The audit is scoped to specific parts of the project rather than covering everything.

the same for me


[12/15/2024 13:30] shawon2212
After I downloaded the dependencies I had run `forge build` to compile the files but I am getting this error. can anyone give me any solutions?
`@DESKTOP-FARNRMN:~/WorkSpace/2024-12-flex-perpetuals$ forge build

[12/15/2024 14:22] flexcmt
what forge version do you use?
```
root@ceb71e26bb46:/app# ~/.foundry/bin/forge --version
forge 0.2.0 (233bff2 2024-12-15T00:25:31.568256602Z)

[12/15/2024 14:28] shawon2212
I use this version `forge 0.2.0 (c13d42e 2024-11-19T00:21:45.549458851Z)`


[12/15/2024 14:54] flexcmt
Is it possible that you are run out of ram or some resources? This project is big. My docker container goes up to 2Gb RAM on first run.


[12/15/2024 14:56] 0xfarman
@Shawon  You can try specific test it's running fine, I was also getting error while compiling all.


[12/15/2024 14:58] shawon2212
No. My ram usage goes upto 87% while compiling


[12/15/2024 14:58] shawon2212
Okay. Thanks


[12/15/2024 15:00] 0xfarman
Yeah it's big project lot's of things to compile. @Shawon

[12/15/2024 15:04] flexcmt
Can suggest try to skip test compilation for the first build
```
~/.foundry/bin/forge build --skip test
```
but it took 2.3Gb for docker container for my any way

[12/15/2024 19:16] kyosi2963
Does the repo include the fixed code or we need to compare everything with the previous audit reports ?


[12/15/2024 19:18] flexcmt
Yes, it includes fixed code. Previous audits were done in 2023.

anyone can let me know what does `intentHandler.sol` do?


[12/17/2024 16:52] flexcmt
Started a thread.


[12/17/2024 16:56] flexcmt
The IntentHandler.sol is a smart contract designed to securely and efficiently manage and execute user intents related to trading operations. It processes user's signed trading orders that are generated and signed on the client side using JavaScript.


[12/17/2024 18:44] harry_cryptodev
thanks


[12/19/2024 14:30] tumelo_crypto
hey just to get some clarity, if a function in a contract that is in scope has an error that will affect a contract that is out of scope, is that bug valid?


[12/19/2024 16:34] flexcmt
yes it is
