**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

# Overview

HMXv2 is an innovative pool-based perpetual DEX protocol designed to offer a range of advanced features. It introduces multi-asset collateral support and cross-margin flexibility, providing traders with enhanced options and opportunities.

The protocol incorporates secured measurements, including virtual price impact and funding fees, to ensure the protection of liquidity providers (LPs) from being overly exposed to a single direction. By implementing these measures, HMXv2 aims to create a more resilient and balanced trading environment.

## Architecture
`v2-evm` uses handler-service-storage pattern, this pattern ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes modularity.

Handlers serve as entry points to the protocol, allowing for interaction with EOA or contracts. They facilitate the flow of data and call between internal protocol and outside world.

Services form the core business logic of the protocol. They handle the processing and execution of various operations, such as trading, liquidating, adding or removing liquidity.

Storages are responsible for storing critical states and data of the protocol.

| Question                                | Answer                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `src/contracts/FLP.sol`                 | ERC20            |
| `src/tokens/FlexTradeCredits.sol`       | ERC721                       |
| `src/handlers/IntentHandler.sol`        | ERC721  | 


# Additional context

## Main invariants

1. `src/contracts/FLP.sol`\
  FLP is a copy of HLP token
    - mintable/burnable only by LiquidityService.sol that mint/burn it with user deposit/withdrawn to liquidity\
      `HLP(_vars.configStorage.hlp()).mint(_receiver, _vars.mintAmount);`
    - transferable token

2. `src/extensions/dexters/AerodromeDexter.sol`
    - should be administered only by owner
    - must swap tokens (called by SwitchCollateralrouter.execute) or revert the transaction on swap error. As run() is public, it shouldn't be used maliciously.

3. `src/handlers/IntentHandler.sol`
    - should be administered by owner only
    - execution must be limited only by IntentExecutors
    - contact signs transactions on client side and Trading orders should be signed only by client private key. Contact must validate this signature so no one can forge an electronic signature or execute transactions of another user.

4. `src/staking/FTCHook.sol`\
  FTCHook is a clone of TLCHook.
    - should be administered only by owner
    - It should be called only by TradeService as it will be a whitelistedCallers.

6. `src/storages/ConfigStorage.sol`
    - As it's a configuration, contracts should be changed only by owner or whitelisted callers.

7. `src/tokens/FlexTradeCredits.sol`\
  FlexTradeCredits is a clone of TraderLoyaltyCredit (TLC).
    - must be minted only by whitelisted minters (FTCHook).
    - represents activity of a user (trader) for current epoch only. So each epoch balances must be independent and should be resetted with new epoch (each week)


## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
None

## All trusted roles in the protocol

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner                           | Has administrative authority                |
| `intentExecutors` in `IntentHandler.sol`  | Trusted                       |
| `whitelistedCallers` (external contract) in `IntentHandler.sol`  |  Trusted             |
| `minter` (external contract) in `lexTradeCredits.sol`  | Trusted                       |
